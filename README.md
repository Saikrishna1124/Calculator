# Calculator
ðŸ“– Project Description

This project is an Enhanced Web-Based Calculator developed using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend. It is designed to go beyond basic arithmetic operations by including several advanced mathematical functions.

The calculator provides a simple yet modern interface where users can enter numbers and perform different operations with a single click. The backend (Flask + Python) handles all the logic and ensures accurate calculations, while the frontend provides an interactive user experience.

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights

Performs basic arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Supports advanced functions: Power, Square Root, Modulo, Factorial

Provides a user-friendly and interactive interface with responsive design

Demonstrates integration of Python backend with a web-based frontend

Can be easily extended to include more scientific operations like logarithms, trigonometric functions, or even calculation history

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this project is to create a calculator that not only handles simple arithmetic but also provides advanced mathematical capabilities in a clean, easy-to-use web environment, combining Python logic with modern web technologies.
